    <h3>Normal Skin Type</h3>
    <p>
      If you have normal skin, you're one of the lucky ones! Your skin is
      well-balanced, with neither too much oil nor dryness. It’s characterized
      by a smooth, even texture with small pores, and it's less prone to acne or
      irritation. To maintain this healthy glow, follow this simple skincare
      routine:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gentle, non-foaming cleanser: This will help cleanse without stripping
        your skin of natural oils.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hydrating, oil-free moisturizer: To keep your skin moisturized without
        feeling greasy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher): Protect your skin from both
        UVA and UVB rays.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once a week, use a light exfoliating scrub or mask: This helps to remove
        dead skin cells and promote a fresh complexion.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For those with normal skin, maintaining balance is key. Avoid
      over-exfoliating or using harsh cleansers, which could disrupt your skin's
      natural barrier.
    </p>

    <h3>Dry Skin Type</h3>
    <p>
      Dry skin often feels tight, rough, and may look dull or flaky. It can
      occur when your skin is not producing enough natural oils, or when the
      skin’s moisture barrier is damaged. To replenish moisture and prevent
      further dryness, try this nourishing skincare routine:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Creamy, hydrating cleanser: Look for a non-stripping formula to cleanse
        without depleting moisture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serum or oil with hyaluronic acid or ceramides: These ingredients help
        to lock in moisture and repair the skin's protective barrier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rich, creamy moisturizer: Opt for a thick, occlusive moisturizer to seal
        in hydration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gentle exfoliating scrub or mask 1-2 times per week: Use a mild scrub to
        remove dead skin without irritating dry patches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Humidifier in your home or office: A humidifier adds moisture to the
        air, helping to prevent further dryness, especially during colder
        months.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Avoid long hot showers or harsh products that can further dry out your
      skin. Instead, focus on restoring moisture and preventing water loss.
    </p>

    <h3>Oily Skin Type</h3>
    <p>
      Oily skin is characterized by an excess production of sebum, which can
      lead to a shiny appearance, clogged pores, and acne. It often occurs in
      the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) but can affect the entire face.
      Follow this targeted skincare routine to keep your complexion balanced and
      blemish-free:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Foaming, oil-free cleanser: A foaming cleanser will remove excess oils
        without adding further moisture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mattifying, oil-absorbing moisturizer: Even oily skin needs moisture,
        but opt for an oil-free, mattifying formula to help control shine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salicylic acid-based toner or serum: Salicylic acid can penetrate deep
        into pores, preventing blockages and breakouts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blotting papers throughout the day: Keep these on hand to absorb excess
        oil without disrupting your makeup or skincare.
      </li>
      <li>
        Weekly clay mask or gentle exfoliating scrub: Clay helps absorb oil,
        while exfoliating scrubs help clear dead skin cells that can lead to
        clogged pores.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Regular cleansing and oil control are crucial, but make sure not to
      over-strip your skin, as this could lead to more oil production in
      response. Hydrate your skin to maintain balance.

    <h3>Combination Skin Type</h3>
    <p>
      Combination skin is a mix of oily and dry areas, usually with an oily
      T-zone and dry cheeks or other areas. This requires a tailored skincare
      routine to balance the different zones and maintain hydration. Here's how
      to address each area:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gentle, non-foaming cleanser: A mild cleanser will clean without
        over-drying or irritating the skin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Oil-free moisturizer for the T-zone: Use a lightweight, oil-free
        moisturizer in areas that tend to be oily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Richer, creamy moisturizer for dry areas: For dry zones, opt for a
        thicker moisturizer to provide extra hydration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mattifying primer or blotting papers for shiny areas: These will help
        control oil in the T-zone, especially throughout the day.
      </li>
      <li>
        Exfoliating mask or gentle scrub 1-2 times per week: Focus on
        exfoliating the T-zone and any areas prone to congestion, while being
        gentle on dry patches.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Combination skin can be tricky, but by customizing your routine for
      different areas, you can maintain healthy skin balance.

    <h3>Sensitive Skin Type</h3>
    <p>
      Sensitive skin is easily irritated by products, environmental factors, or
      changes in temperature. It often manifests as redness, itching, burning,
      or even rashes. To calm and protect sensitive skin, follow this soothing
      skincare routine:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fragrance-free, creamy cleanser: Avoid harsh or fragranced cleansers
        that can further irritate sensitive skin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hypoallergenic, fragrance-free moisturizer: Opt for gentle,
        non-irritating moisturizers that strengthen the skin’s barrier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Soothing serum with ingredients like centella or ceramides: These
        ingredients help repair and calm irritated skin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mineral sunscreen (no chemical filters): Mineral sunscreens are less
        likely to irritate sensitive skin compared to chemical sunscreens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gentle, low-pH exfoliating wash or mask 1-2 times per week: Be cautious
        with exfoliation and choose gentle formulas that won’t irritate the
        skin.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Avoid using too many products at once, and always patch test new products
      to ensure they are safe for your skin. Focus on calming, strengthening,
      and protecting the skin barrier.
